PROBLEM STATEMENT :
A number of cars are to be produced on an assembly line where each
car is customized with a specific set of options such as air-
conditioning, sunroof, navigation, and so on . The assembly line moves
through several workstations for the installation of these options. The
cars cannot be positioned randomly since each of these workstations
have limited capacity and need time to set up the options as the
assembly line is moving in front of the station. These capacities
constraints are formalized using constraints of the form m out of N,
which indicates that the workstation can install the option on m out of
every sequence of N cars. The car sequencing problem is to determine
a sequencing of the cars on the assembly line that satisfies the
demand constraints for each set of car options and the capacity
constraints for each workstation.

In this particular case
Ten cars need to be customized with five possible options. A class of car is
defined by a specific set of options; there are six Classes of cars.
